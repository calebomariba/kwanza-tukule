## Introduction
This project aims to analyze sales data to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and provide strategic recommendations. It involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, forecasting, and dashboard creation using various analytical tools.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Data Quality Assessment
- Inspected dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.
- Summarized identified issues and outlined corrective measures.

### Feature Engineering
- Created a new column **Month-Year** from the **DATE** column.
- Screenshot of the transformation is provided in the submission.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Sales Overview
- Calculated total **Quantity** and **Value** grouped by:
  - **Anonymized Category**
  - **Anonymized Business**
- Provided visualizations such as bar charts and tables to illustrate insights.

### Trends Over Time
- Analyzed **sales trends** over time using the **Month-Year** column.
- Created a **time series plot** to highlight seasonal patterns or performance fluctuations.

### Performance Analysis
- Identified **Top 5 most frequently purchased products** based on **Quantity**.
- Identified **Top 5 most valuable products** based on **Value**.

## Advanced Analysis
### Customer Segmentation
Performed segmentation analysis of businesses based on:
1. **Total Quantity purchased**
2. **Total Value contributed**
3. **Frequency of transactions**

- Classified businesses into three groups:
  - **High Value**
  - **Medium Value**
  - **Low Value**
- Provided engagement recommendations for each group.

### Forecasting
- Forecasted total **sales (Value)** for the next **three months** using:
  - ARIMA
  - Moving average
  - Exponential smoothing

### Anomaly Detection
- Identified **unusual spikes or drops** in sales performance.
- Explained possible reasons based on data patterns.

### Correlation Analysis
- Examined relationships between **Quantity** and **Value**.
- Provided insights into key factors driving sales performance.

## Strategic Insights and Recommendations
### Product Strategy
- Recommended a **product category** for marketing campaigns based on the analysis.
- Justified selection using data-driven insights.

### Customer Retention
- Identified businesses with declining purchase frequency.
- Suggested strategies to **re-engage** inactive customers.

### Operational Efficiency
- Recommended improvements to **inventory management** and **supply chain** processes.
- Addressed seasonal demand fluctuations.

## Dashboard and Reporting
Created an interactive dashboard summarizing key insights, including:
- **Total Quantity and Value** by **Anonymized Category**.
- **Top-performing products and businesses**.
- **Time-series chart** of sales trends.
- **Customer segmentation summary**.

Tools used:
- **Streamlit** / **Plotly** 

> **Note:** A screenshot or link to the dashboard is included in the submission.

## Bonus Section: Open-Ended Problem
### Predictive Analysis
- Proposed external factors influencing sales (e.g., **economic conditions, competitor actions**).
- Suggested methodologies for incorporating these factors in future analyses.

### Scalability
- Discussed optimizations for **data storage, processing, and analysis** if dataset size increases **10x**.

## Instructions and Guidelines
